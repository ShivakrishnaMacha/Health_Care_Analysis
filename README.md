# National Health Survey: Health Care Dashboard  

## Problem Statement  
The National Health Survey aimed to assess healthcare access, education levels, and chronic disease prevalence across India. However, the data was large and complex, making it challenging for stakeholders to derive actionable insights. The objective was to create an interactive and intuitive Power BI dashboard to visualize key healthcare metrics, identify trends, and support evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and public health officials.

## Overview  
The National Health Survey gathers data to assess healthcare access, chronic disease prevalence, education levels, and hospitalization rates across India. Using this dataset, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to present key insights that can guide public health decisions and policy improvements.

## Objective  
The goal of this project was to design a dynamic dashboard that provides actionable insights into critical healthcare metrics, such as chronic disease prevalence, health scheme coverage, and demographic trends, using data from the National Health Survey.

## Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Exploration  
- Analyzed the dataset containing demographic, healthcare, and educational data of individuals across Indian states and districts.  
- Key fields examined include relationships within households, marital status, education levels, hospitalization rates, and health scheme coverage.  

### 2. Data Preparation  
- Connected the dataset to Power BI for data visualization.  
- Performed data cleaning tasks, including:  
  - Resolving missing values and inconsistencies in hospitalization and chronic disease fields.  
  - Standardizing categorical variables like gender and education codes.  

### 3. Data Modeling  
- Created relationships between data tables using unique identifiers like state and district codes.  
- Established measures for key metrics such as total male and female populations, chronic disease prevalence, and health scheme coverage.  

### 4. Dashboard Design  
- Designed the Power BI dashboard with the following features:  
  - **Relational Head Distribution**: Visualized household relationships using a pie chart.  
  - **Education Levels**: Illustrated literacy and education distribution.  
  - **State-wise Hospitalization**: Bar chart showing hospitalization rates across states.  
  - **Chronic Disease Analysis**: Highlighted the proportion of individuals with chronic illnesses.  
  - **Health Scheme Coverage**: Showed coverage percentages using a pie chart.  
  - **Gender-wise Health Scheme Access**: Compared male and female beneficiaries.  
  - Other visualizations include marital status, chronic disease history, and reporting methods (self or proxy).  

### 5. Insights from the Dashboard  
- 95.6% of respondents were not covered under any government health schemes.  
- Chronic illnesses affected a small fraction of respondents, with most reporting no significant health issues.  
- States like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra had the highest hospitalization rates.  
- Education data revealed that over 30% of respondents were not literate, highlighting a need for targeted awareness campaigns.

## Key Deliverables  
- A user-friendly Power BI dashboard that allows stakeholders to analyze healthcare data interactively.  
- Identification of patterns and trends in health scheme coverage, hospitalization, and education.  
- Data-backed recommendations for improving health policies and targeting interventions.  

---

## Future Scope  
- Integrating more granular data, such as income levels and urban vs. rural classifications, to enhance insights.  
- Adding time-series data for trend analysis of health metrics over multiple years.  
- Improving interactivity with features like drill-through and cross-filtering for deeper exploration.
